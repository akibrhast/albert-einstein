                          <p class="mb-0">Albert Einstein's lifelong passion for physics was sparked at the age of four or five when his father showed him a small compass. 
                              Young Albert tried to imagine the mysterious force that caused the compass needle to move, 
                              and the experience awakened a sense of wonder that stayed with him for life. 
                              Understanding the universe became an "eternal riddle" for Einstein, a quest for scientific enlightenment. 
                              "The road to this paradise was not as comfortable and alluring as the road to the religious paradise," he wrote, "but it has proved itself as trustworthy, 
                              and I have never regretted having chosen it."
                              Einstein deftly navigated scientific problems, but he charted the path through his turbulent personal life with less success. 
                              His passionate romance and subsequent marriage to physicist Mileva Mari ended bitterly, alienating him from their two sons. 
                              Einstein's life was punctuated by love affairs—one of which, with his cousin Elsa Löwenthal, led to a second marriage.

                          <p class="mb-0">The couple had one child, Lieserl, out of wedlock in 1902. Two years later Hans Albert was born, followed by Eduard in 1910. 
                              The boys were close to their father until he and Mileva separated in 1914. Reflecting back on his relationship with Einstein, Hans Albert remarked, 
                              "Probably the only project he ever gave up on was me." Eduard suffered from health problems throughout much of his life. 
                              He lived with his mother in Zurich until she died in 1948.
                              Einstein loved the company of women almost as much as he loved physics. It is perhaps no coincidence that his first wife, Mileva Mari, 
                              was a fellow physics student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. "My dear kitten," wrote Einstein in a 1901 letter, 
                              "I just read a wonderful paper by Lenard on the generation of cathode rays by ultraviolet light."
                              Albert's passion for Mileva ran deep, but that didn't stop him from meeting other women when they were apart. Still climbing the academic ladder, Einstein 
                              frequently traveled for work, and he met his cousin Elsa Löwenthal while on a brief trip to Berlin in 1912. By the time Albert and Mileva divorced in 1919, 
                              he had been living with Elsa for nearly five years; She soon became his second wife. But Einstein's flirtatious, often secretive letters written over the 
                              course of the next 36 years attest to his many affairs throughout the rest of his life.</p>

                              with his cousin, Elsa. He and Maric finally divorced several years later in 1919. As part of their separation agreement, Einstein promised her an annual 
                              stipend plus whatever money he might receive from the Nobel Prize—which he was supremely confident he would eventually win. Maric agreed, 
                              and Einstein later handed over a small fortune upon receiving the award in 1922 for his work on the photoelectric effect. By then, he had already 
                              remarried to Elsa, who remained his wife until her death in 1936.

                          <p class="">In 1900, at age 21, Einstein had his university diploma and was eager to begin his career as a physicist. 
                            He struggled to find work, however. After two years of searching, 
                            Einstein took a relatively low-level job at the patent office in Bern, Switzerland.
                            Glad for the income and steady work reviewing patent applications--and still able to think about physics after hours—Einstein settled into a comfortable routine. 
                            Each day he walked to work through the streets of Bern, a city famous for its medieval architecture and beautiful clock towers.
                          </p>
                          <p class="mb-0">Einstein passed by the clock towers again on his way home, 
                            a route he often took with his closest friend, Michele Besso. 
                            The two men regularly discussed science and philosophy—including the nature of time. 
                            After one such discussion, Einstein came to a sudden realization: Time is not absolute. 
                            In other words, despite our common perception that a second is always a second everywhere in the universe, 
                            the rate at which time flows depends upon where you are and how fast you are traveling. Einstein thanked Besso 
                            in his first paper on the Special Theory of Relativity.

                          <p class="">The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr. 
                              Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science. An account of the debates was written by Bohr in an article 
                              titled "Discussions with Einstein on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics".
                              Despite their differences of opinion regarding quantum mechanics, Bohr and Einstein had a mutual admiration that was to last the rest of their lives.
                              The debates represent one of the highest points of scientific research in the first half of the twentieth century because it called attention to an element of quantum 
                              theory, quantum non-locality, which is central to our modern understanding of the physical world.

                          <p class="">For hundreds of years, there was an immutable law of physics that was never challenged: 
                                      that in any reaction occurring in the Universe, mass was conserved. 
                                      That no matter what you put in, what reacted, and what came out, the sum of what you began with and the sum of what you ended with would be equal. 
                                      But under the laws of special relativity, mass simply couldn't be the ultimate conserved quantity, since different observers would disagree about what 
                                      the energy of a system was. Instead, Einstein was able to derive a law that we still use today, governed by one of the simplest but most powerful 
                                      equations ever to be written down, E = mc2.
